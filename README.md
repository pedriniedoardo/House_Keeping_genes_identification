# identify-HK-genes
comparison of three different approaches to rank genes in order to identify best candidate HK.
For the test I used the same dataset ("testHK.csv"). This is composed of 9 biological replicates per two "treatment" (18 samples overall), defined by 14 variables (genes). the data are non-log value of expression.
